							With everything that's been happening to us lately, this last show of ours at the world famous Whisky-A-Go-Go opening up for a band we really look up to was a bright light in the midst of dark uncertainty. Without the much appreciated help of Jack Terrent and Jayden Hammer (from <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2SbauLKBtTvW9bS4cZRvHy">Novicain Road</a>) filling in on bass and lead guitar, this show surely would have been a disaster, should we have even played it at all. With that said, we'd like to start being more open with our followers about what we've gone through and what we're currently going through as a band. Soon we will be putting together a video detailing a brief history of our band and our situation as of right now. Until then, we hope you enjoy this live video from our latest performance at the Whisky-A-Go-Go opening up for L.A. Guns. <div class="yesdevil">-YES DEVIL</div>
