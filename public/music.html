					<h5>Smoke & Mirrors</h5>
					Deadly affliction in our bones <br>
					Radiation in our zones <br>
					<br>
					I see it in you, I see it in you <br>
					I see it in me, I see it in me <br>
					I see it in you, I see it in you <br>
					I see it in me, I see it in us <br>
					<br>
					Mirrors in a maze will take us to our graves <br>
					Lead the way down straight through the fire <br>
					As we go, we only get higher <br>
					<br>
					Deadly attraction in my dreams <br>
					Oh I'm addicted to your design <br>
					and I know, you're designed to please <br>
					So listen up my brothers <br>
					All we got is eachother <br>
					and that sure means something to me <br><br>
					I see it in you, I see it in you <br>
					I see it in me, I see it in me <br>
					I see it in you, I see it in you <br>
					I see it in me, I see it in us <br>
					<br>
					Mirrors in a maze will take us to our graves <br>
					Lead the way down straight through the fire <br>
					As we go, we only get higher <br>
					Yeah <br>
					<br>
					Higher we will reach, higher we will reach <br>
					Heaven we will seize, heaven we will sieze <br>
					<br>
					A deep devotion, can't keep it to myself <br>
					Threw it in the ocean, back to the shelf <br>
					I'm through fighting this fight <br>
					I'll give it up to you <br>
					A sweet sacrifice, a piece of me to do <br>
					anything with, anywhere, whatever you would please <br>
					All I ask is if you would please remember me <br>
					All through your darknest nights <br>
					All through your brightest hours <br>
					Just know I will be forever by your side <br>
					<br>
					Mirrors in a maze will take us to our graves <br>
					Lead the way down straight through the fire <br>
					As we go, we only get higher <br>
					Yeah <br>
					<br>
					Higher we will reach, higher we will reach <br>
					Heaven we will seize, heaven we will sieze <br>
					<br>
