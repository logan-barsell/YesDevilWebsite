						| 					I see it in me, I see it in us 
						br
						br
						| 					Mirrors in a maze will take us to our graves 
						br
						| 					Lead the way down straight through the fire 
						br
						| 					As we go, we only get higher 
						br
						br
						| 					Deadly attraction in my dreams 
						br
						| 					Oh I'm addicted to your design 
						br
						| 					and I know, you're designed to please 
						br
						| 					So listen up my brothers 
						br
						| 					All we got is eachother 
						br
						| 					and that sure means something to me 
						br
						br
						| 					I see it in you, I see it in you 
						br
						| 					I see it in me, I see it in me 
						br
						| 					I see it in you, I see it in you 
						br
						| 					I see it in me, I see it in us 
						br
						br
						| 					Mirrors in a maze will take us to our graves 
						br
						| 					Lead the way down straight through the fire 
						br
						| 					As we go, we only get higher 
						br
						| 					Yeah 
						br
						br
						| 					Higher we will reach, higher we will reach 
						br
						| 					Heaven we will seize, heaven we will sieze 
						br
						br
						| 					A deep devotion, can't keep it to myself 
						br
						| 					Threw it in the ocean, back to the shelf 
						br
						| 					I'm through fighting this fight 
						br
						| 					I'll give it up to you 
						br
						| 					A sweet sacrifice, a piece of me to do 
						br
						| 					anything with, anywhere, whatever you would please 
						br
						| 					All I ask is if you would please remember me 
						br
						| 					All through your darknest nights 
						br
						| 					All through your brightest hours 
						br
						| 					Just know I will be forever by your side 
						br
						br
						| 					Mirrors in a maze will take us to our graves 
						br
						| 					Lead the way down straight through the fire 
						br
						| 					As we go, we only get higher 
						br
						| 					Yeah 
						br
						br
						| 					Higher we will reach, higher we will reach 
						br
						| 					Heaven we will seize, heaven we will sieze
